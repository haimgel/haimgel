### Who is Haim Gelfenbeyn?
I’m a software engineer currently from Ontario, Canada. I’ve worked with quite a range of different platforms and
technologies, from Windows GUI to Web applications, with detours into DevOps, device drivers, and mobile development.
Today, I'm building awesome software for [Theorem](https://theorem.co) clients.

In my spare time, I enjoy woodworking, improving my home automation setup, 3D printing, spending time with my family.
