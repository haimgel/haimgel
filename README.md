### Who is Haim Gelfenbeyn?
Software engineer focused on distributed systems and cloud platforms. I'm passionate about system architecture,
mentoring teams, and solving complex technical challenges. Currently at Apple, still learning something new
every day.

Outside of work, I enjoy woodworking, tinkering with home automation, 3D printing, and spending time with family.
